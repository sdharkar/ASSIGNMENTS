                <h3>Carl Pei</h3>
                <p> Smartphone maker OnePlus gained popularity by selling feature-packed android phones for a lot less than market peers. The company claims it made more than $300 million in revenue in its first year in 2014.OnePlus, which now sells in 36 countries, has since followed up with OnePlusTwo and OnePlusX. Pei grew up in Stockholm and studied at the Stockholm School of Economics. He dropped out before finishing his degree. Before founding OnePlus, Pei worked at smartphone makers Meizu, OPPO and Nokia. Carl Pei, or Pei Yu; born September 11, 1989S, is a Chinese-born Swedish Internet entrepreneur. He co-founded OnePlus along with Pete Lau, in 2013 and was the director of OnePlus Global. He left the firm in September 2020 to start a new hardware venture, called "Nothing".</p>
                
            <p>Pei joined Nokia in 2010 and worked at the company for three months. After Nokia, the fan website Pei had created about Meizu had caught the attention of that company's Hong Kong branch, and Pei started working in Meizu's marketing team in 2011. In November he joined Oppo as its international markets manager, where he worked directly under Pete Lau.</p>
            <p>Pei co-founded OnePlus with Pete Lau in Shenzhen, Guangdong in December 2013. Their first device, the OnePlus One, sold close to a million units in 2014, despite a sales target of only 50,000. In July 2015, Pei presented the OnePlus 2 through a virtual reality video on YouTube. It was claimed to be the first product launch in virtual reality and has been viewed over 296,000 times as of October 2020. After the unveiling of the OnePlus 3 in June 2016, Pei claimed it was the company's most popular smartphone, based on the Net Promoter Score. When asked in November 2016, Pei said the reason for the upgrade after only three months was that they did not want to wait to improve the hardware. Pei claimed the OnePlus 5 to be their fastest-selling device to date shortly after its release in June 2017.</p>
            <p>Following his departure from OnePlus, Pei announced Nothing on January 27, 2021. According to Pei, Nothingâ€™s mission is to remove barriers between people and technology to create a seamless digital future. The company is based in London and gathers several notorious investors, such as iPod inventor Tony Fadell, Twitch co-founder Kevin Lin, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, and YouTuber Casey Neistat. On February 25, the company announced Teenage Engineering as founding partners, mainly responsible for the design aesthetic of the brand and its products.
            Nothing's first product "ear (1)" has been launched on July 27, 2021.</p>
